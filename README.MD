# BOIDS Simulation

## Overview
The BOIDS project is a Python-based simulation for exploring the fascinating dynamics of flocking behavior. By leveraging the principles of the Boids algorithm, this simulation provides a visually engaging demonstration of complex behaviors emerging from simple rules.

## Features
- **Dynamic Flocking Simulation**: Real-time flocking dynamics with adjustable parameters to explore different behaviors.
- **Interactive Controls**: Manipulate conditions within the simulation to observe how changes affect the flock.
- **Modular Design**: Extensible codebase allowing easy incorporation of additional behaviors or modifications.
- **Quad Tree Optimisation**: The simulation runntime is optimised with by utilising a quad tree.
- **UI**: Hide or show the UI by pressing "U".

## Getting Started
To set up the simulation locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/omorio/BOIDS.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd BOIDS

# Run the simulation
python main.py
